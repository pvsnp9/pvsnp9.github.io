Hi, I’m **Tsuyog Basnet** — a researcher, engineer, and lifelong learner passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, human potential, and creative innovation.


I am a doctoral student, my research is rooted in **multimodal machine learning**, **generative modeling**, and **large language models**. With a strong foundation in **computer science**, **Machine Learning**, and **neuroscience-inspired AI**, I strive to bridge the gap between technical complexity and real-world impact.

Before my doctoral journey, I earned an **MSc in Computer Science** from the **University of Regina** , reflecting my belief that true intelligence — human or artificial — thrives when technology, health, and cognition intersect.

Whether you’re a fellow researcher, a builder, or someone curious about how AI and personal development intertwine, you’ll find insights here designed to **challenge**, **inspire**, and **equip** you to create at the highest level.

Thanks for being here. Let’s grow, build, and innovate — **unapologetically**.
