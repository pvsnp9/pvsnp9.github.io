    "The teacher BERT comprises encoder layers, starting with an input sentence fed into an embedding layer to obtain input embeddings. These embeddings are then passed through the encoder layers, which utilize self-attention to learn contextual relations within the input sentence, resulting in a representation. This representation is forwarded to the prediction layer, typically a feedforward network. In tasks like masked language modeling, the prediction layer returns logits for all words in the vocabulary, considering the masked word. Utilizing the pre-trained BERT-Base model as the teacher, which consists of 12 encoder layers and attention heads, producing 768-dimensional representations, with a total of 110 million parameters.\n",

Specifically, the student BERT employs 4 encoder layers. Additionally, the representation size (hidden state dimension) is set to 312. Notably, the number of parameters in the student BERT is substantially lower, totaling 14.5 million parameters."
