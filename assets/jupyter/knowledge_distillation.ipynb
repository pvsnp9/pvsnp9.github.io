    "Here, we discusses the challenges associated with using pre-trained BERT models for downstream tasks due to their computational expense and high resource requirements. we highlight the difficulty of deploying these models on edge devices such as mobile phones. To address this issue, we explore knowledge distillation as a method to transfer knowledge from large pre-trained BERT models to smaller variants. \n",

    "Knowledge distillation in BERT involves transferring knowledge from a large, pre-trained BERT model to a smaller variant. The process aims to distill the knowledge learned by the large model into a more compact form that retains most of its performance. This allows for reducing the computational resources required for inference, making the model more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. During knowledge distillation, the smaller model learns from the soft targets or logits produced by the larger model, effectively learning to mimic its behavior. This process typically involves training the smaller model on a combination of the original training data and the soft targets produced by the larger model. Overall, knowledge distillation enables the creation of efficient BERT models that maintain high performance while being more lightweight and computationally efficient.\n",
